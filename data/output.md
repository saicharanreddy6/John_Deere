general guidelines:

1. Pull the pin. Hold the
extinguisher with the nozzle pointing away from you, and release the
locking mechanism. 


2. Aim low. Point the extinguisher
at the base of the fire.


3. Squeeze the lever slowly
and evenly.


4. Sweep the nozzle from
side-to-side.




### Avoid Static Electricity Risk When Refueling

![Explosion]
![Explosion]
*Explosion*

The removal of sulfur and other compounds in Ultra-Low Sulfur
Diesel (ULSD) fuel decreases its conductivity and increases its ability
to store a static charge.

Refineries may have treated the fuel with a static dissipating
additive. However, there are many factors that can reduce the effectiveness
of the additive over time.

Static charges can build up in ULSD fuel while it is flowing
through fuel delivery systems. Static electricity discharge when combustible
vapors are present could result in a fire or explosion.

Therefore, it is important to ensure that the entire system
used to refuel your machine (fuel supply tank, transfer pump, transfer
hose, nozzle, and others) is properly grounded and bonded. Consult
with your fuel or fuel system supplier to ensure that the delivery
system is in compliance with fueling standards for proper grounding
and bonding practices.


### Wear Protective Clothing

![Protective Clothing]

1. Get medical attention immediately.


### Clean Exhaust Filter Safely

![Fire Safety]
![Fire Safety]
![Fire Safety]
*Fire Safety*

During exhaust filter cleaning operations, the engine may run
at elevated idle and hot temperatures for an extended period of time.
Exhaust gases and exhaust filter components reach temperatures hot
enough to burn people, or ignite or melt common materials.

Keep machine away from people, animals, or structures which
may be susceptible to harm or damage from hot exhaust gases or components.
Avoid potential fire or explosion hazards from flammable materials
and vapors near the exhaust. Keep exhaust outlet away from people
and anything that can melt, burn, or explode.

Closely monitor machine and surrounding area for smoldering
debris during and after exhaust filter cleaning.

Adding fuel while an engine is running can create a fire or
explosion hazard. Always stop engine before refueling machine and
clean up any spilled fuel.

Always make sure that engine is stopped while hauling machine
on a truck or trailer.

Contact with exhaust components while still hot can result in
serious personal injury.

Avoid contact with these components until cooled to safe temperatures.

If service procedure requires engine to be running:

Keep hands, feet, and clothing away from power-driven parts.

Always disable movement (neutral), set the parking brake or
mechanism and disconnect power to attachments or tools before leaving
the operator’s station.

Shut off engine and remove key (if equipped) before leaving
the machine unattended.

- Only engage power-driven parts required by service procedure
- Ensure that other people are clear of operator station
and machine


### Avoid Hot Exhaust

![Safety—Hot Parts]
*Safety—Hot Parts*

Servicing machine or attachments with engine running can result
in serious personal injury. Avoid exposure and skin contact with hot
exhaust gases and components.

Exhaust parts and streams become very hot during operation.
Exhaust gases and components reach temperatures hot enough to burn
people, ignite, or melt common materials.


### Operator Presence System and Rotational Alarm System

The operator presence system indicates the presence of the operator.
When the operator is out of the seat, the system prevents the engagement
of the following systems:



Rotational Alarm System
If the operator leaves the seat for more than 5 seconds with
the header and/or separator engaged, the header and unloading auger
are automatically disengaged. After 11 seconds, the separator and
propulsion (ProDriveProDrive is a trademark of Deere & Company™ and ProDriveProDrive is a trademark of Deere & Company™ XL only) are disengaged. If the operator remains out of the seat,
the harvesting functions disengage. Lights flash and an alarm sounds
until the harvesting functions have stopped. The engine will continue
to run.

To restart functions, the operator must return to the seat and
re-engage each function.

## Operating the Engine

### Clean Exhaust Filter Safely

![Fire Safety]
![Fire Safety]
![Fire Safety]
*Fire Safety*

During exhaust filter cleaning operations, the engine may run
at elevated idle and hot temperatures for an extended period of time.
Exhaust gases and exhaust filter components reach temperatures hot
enough to burn people, or ignite or melt common materials.

Keep machine away from people, animals, or structures which
may be susceptible to harm or damage from hot exhaust gases or components.
Avoid potential fire or explosion hazards from flammable materials
and vapors near the exhaust. Keep exhaust outlet away from people
and anything that can melt, burn, or explode.

Closely monitor machine and surrounding area for smoldering
debris during and after exhaust filter cleaning.

Adding fuel while an engine is running can create a fire or
explosion hazard. Always stop engine before refueling machine and
clean up any spilled fuel.

Always make sure that engine is stopped while hauling machine
on a truck or trailer.

Contact with exhaust components while still hot can result in
serious personal injury.

Avoid contact with these components until cooled to safe temperatures.

If service procedure requires engine to be running:

Keep hands, feet, and clothing away from power-driven parts.

Always disable movement (neutral), set the parking brake or
mechanism and disconnect power to attachments or tools before leaving
the operator’s station.

Shut off engine and remove key (if equipped) before leaving
the machine unattended.

- Only engage power-driven parts required by service procedure
- Ensure that other people are clear of operator station
and machine


### Avoid Hot Exhaust

![Safety—Hot Parts]
*Safety—Hot Parts*

Servicing machine or attachments with engine running can result
in serious personal injury. Avoid exposure and skin contact with hot
exhaust gases and components.

Exhaust parts and streams become very hot during operation.
Exhaust gases and components reach temperatures hot enough to burn
people, ignite, or melt common materials.


### Aftertreatment Indicators Overview

**IMPORTANT**: The operator will be informed by the operator warning
system when the emission control system does not function correctly
and/or an engine malfunction is detected by the engine control unit.
Ignoring the operator warning signals will lead to an emission related
derate, resulting in an effective disablement of non-road mobile machinery
operation.

It is essential to take prompt action to rectify any incorrect
operation, use or maintenance of the emissions control system in accordance
with the rectification measures indicated by the warnings referenced
below.

The Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) indicator illuminates when the
DEF is low. Fill DEF tank.

When the DEF indicator is combined with the warning indicator
or engine stop indicator engine performance is reduced by the Engine
Control Unit (ECU) because the DEF is below a measurable level. Fill
DEF tank.

When engine emissions temperature indicator illuminates exhaust
gas temperature is high, elevated idle is active, or exhaust filter
cleaning is in process. The machine can be operated as normal unless
the operator determines the machine is not in a safe location for
high exhaust temperatures and disables auto cleaning.

When engine emissions temperature indicator is combined with
the warning indicator or engine stop indicator engine performance
is reduced by the ECU because the exhaust gas temperature is higher
than expected. Follow Diagnostic Trouble Code (DTC) procedure or see
your authorized servicing dealer.

When the exhaust filter indicator illuminates the exhaust filter
cleaning is in process, aftertreatment system has a fault, or the
exhaust filter is in need of cleaning and the operator has disabled
auto exhaust filter cleaning. If conditions are safe, the operator
should enable the auto exhaust filter clean setting or perform manual
service regeneration or follow DTC procedure.

When the exhaust filter indicator is combined with the warning
indicator engine performance is reduced by the ECU because there is
an aftertreatment system fault or the soot level of the exhaust filter
is moderately high. If conditions are safe, the operator should enable
the auto exhaust filter clean function. If conditions are not safe,
the operator should move the machine to a safe location and engage
the auto exhaust filter cleaning mode. Perform manual service regeneration
or follow DTC procedure.

When the exhaust filter indicator is combined with the engine
stop indicator engine performance is further reduced by the ECU because
there is an aftertreatment system fault or the soot level of the exhaust
filter is extremely high. If this combination is present, see your
authorized servicing dealer.

The auto cleaning disabled indicator illuminates when the operator
has engaged the request to disable the auto exhaust filter cleaning
function. This icon remains illuminated until the operator re-engages
automatic exhaust filter cleaning from the diagnostic gauge. Disabling
auto mode is not recommended for any situation unless it is safety-related
or if the fuel tank lacks the required fuel to complete the cleaning
process.

The engine emissions system malfunction indicator illuminates
when engine emissions are outside of normal operating range or engine
emissions system fault. Follow DTC procedure or see your authorized
servicing dealer.

When the engine emissions system malfunction indicator is combined
with the warning indicator engine performance is reduced by the ECU
because the engine emissions are outside of normal operating range
or engine emissions system fault. Follow DTC procedure or see your
authorized servicing dealer.

house can continue to lower. Further lowering of the feeder house
drives the attachment frame and center draper pan into the ground
causing draper pan damage.


**NOTE**: This method is useful when stubble is higher than desired
when cresting terraces or hills. These types of terrain features may
require you to manually adjust the cutterbar position by raising and
lowering the gauge wheels to maintain a consistent cut height.

Total Loss Indicator bar graph is now a visual guide. You
can refer to the corner post display periodically to know when an
increase or decrease in the total loss amount occurs.

If the total loss indicator bar graph is above or below the green
area and losses are acceptable, the grain loss monitor is either incorrectly
adjusted or there is a higher flow of material through the machine
since the grain loss monitor was last calibrated. Higher flow of material
can be caused by increased ground speed or higher crop yields.

When the machine encounters a “slug”, the middle bar graph will
fluctuate upward (15 to 20 seconds) and then return to the previous
reading. Ignore these fluctuations when this occurs.

### Exhaust Filter System Overview

**NOTE**: For more information, refer to Fuels and Lubricants section
in the machine Operator's Manual.


**CAUTION**: When AUTO or PARKED cleaning is enabled, the exhaust
temperature can be high under no load or light load conditions at
certain times during the exhaust filter cleaning cycle.

Servicing machine or attachments during the exhaust filter cleaning
can result in serious personal injury. Avoid exposure and skin contact
with hot exhaust gases and components.

During auto or
manual/stationary exhaust filter cleaning operations, the engine runs
at elevated temperatures for up to 45 minutes. To avoid injury or
fire, verify exhaust filter, components, and outlet are free of debris.
During entire cleaning process, keep exhaust outlet away from people,
buildings, and anything that can melt, burn, or explode.


Your machine is equipped with an emission-compliant engine,
which cleans and filters the exhaust. Under normal machine operation
and with the system in AUTO mode, the system requires minimal operator
interaction.

To avoid the unnecessary buildup of diesel particulates or soot
in the exhaust filter system:

AUTO Mode— automated process
that performs exhaust filter cleaning during normal operation.

Disable AUTO Exhaust Filter—
in conditions where it can be unsafe for elevated exhaust temperatures.



Parked Filter Cleaning
Parked Filter Cleaning— process
which allows the system to perform additional exhaust filter cleaning
when required.

Engine Cool Down— period of
cool down after exhaust filter cleaning.

- 

Auto Exhaust Filter Cleaning
Utilize AUTO Exhaust Filter Cleaning mode.
- Avoid unnecessary idling.
- Use proper engine oil.
- Use only ultra low sulfur fuel.


### AUTO Exhaust Filter Cleaning

**CAUTION**: When AUTO or PARKED cleaning is enabled, the exhaust
temperature can be high under no load or light load conditions at
certain times during the exhaust filter cleaning cycle. Disable exhaust
filter cleaning system in conditions where it can be unsafe for elevated
exhaust temperatures.


**IMPORTANT**: Damage to engine components can occur if engine is
turned OFF while performing exhaust filter cleaning or shortly after
cleaning is complete. Alarm sounds and a warning message appears on
display. Start machine and follow messages on display to allow components
to cool. See Engine Cool Down In Progress.


**NOTE**: If a filter cleaning is requested while the machine is
stationary and not in harvesting mode, a caution will appear on-screen.
After reading the caution, you must select Accept or Cancel before
continuing.




Auto Exhaust Filter Cleaning
AUTO Mode allows the Exhaust Filter System to perform exhaust
filter cleaning as required. Corner post display indicator and armrest
display provide you with information related to exhaust filter system
activity.

temperatures.


### Parked Filter Cleaning

**CAUTION**: When AUTO or PARKED cleaning is enabled, the exhaust
temperature can be high under no load or light load conditions at
certain times during the exhaust filter cleaning cycle.

Servicing machine or attachments during the exhaust filter cleaning
can result in serious personal injury. Avoid exposure and skin contact
with hot exhaust gases and components.

During auto or
manual/stationary exhaust filter cleaning operations, the engine runs
at elevated idle and hot temperatures for an extended period. Exhaust
gases and exhaust filter components reach temperatures hot enough
to burn people, or ignite, or melt common materials.


**NOTE**: System defaults to AUTO mode when parked exhaust filter
cleaning is complete.


Parked Filter Cleaning is a process which you initiate to clean
the exhaust filter when required.

During the process, engine speed is controlled by the system,
and the machine must remain parked to complete the procedure. Time
required for the Parked Filter Cleaning process is dependent upon
the level of exhaust filter restriction, ambient temperatures, and
current exhaust gas temperature.

### ActiveYield™ | Status Indicator

**NOTE**: A sample is not a complete grain tank. Recording of a
sample starts when the ActiveYieldActiveYield is a trademark of Deere &
Company™ sensors are fully covered with
grain and stops at about 3000 kg (6614 lbs). A sample can be rejected
in the following conditions:


**Inconsistent Flow**— the mass flow variation
was too large to generate acceptable calibration load.

**Uneven Loading/Grain Pile Shift Detected**— grain tank loading was not within the parameters to generate an
accepted calibration load. This could be due to excessive grain shifts
in the grain tank caused by quick acceleration/deceleration of the
machine or travelling over rough terrain.

**Pitch or Roll Too Large**— if the pitch
or roll angle of the machine was larger than 4° during sample collection,
the load will be rejected.

**Collection Interrupted**— if harvesting
stopped or the unloading auger was engaged while sample collection
was in progress, the load will be rejected.

**400 Seconds Exceeded**— a load will
be rejected if it has not reached its minimum load size after 400
seconds (6 minutes and 40 seconds).

**Mass Flow Vibration Calibration Not Conducted**— not performing the mass flow vibration calibration can trigger
inconsistent flow conditions or cause the mass flow to not be detected
at all. A load can be rejected or will not start to be recorded.

**Status Indicators**

Status Indicator displays the status of record samples and a
message about that status.

Status options are as follows:

### ActiveYield™ | Calibration Correction

**NOTE**: The offset correction is only valid until the next  accepted
load is collected. ActiveYield­™ adjusts the yield calibration as
more loads are accepted.


**IMPORTANT**: Do not adjust the correction value with less than
15 accepted samples completed.


Calibration Correction allows you to fix discrepancies in the ActiveYieldActiveYield
is a trademark of Deere & Company™ calculated
yield values between two or more machines operating in the same field.

Adjust the offset correction when one machine is calculating
yield values more accurately than the other machines when checked
by a scale. Do not adjust the offset correction unless there is more
than 4% error in the yield values between the most accurate machine
and the other machine or machines.

**Procedure to Determine Offset Correction:**

**Procedure to Modify Offset Correction:**

1. Harvest at least 15 accepted
samples at a consistent moisture and ground speed.


2. Harvest and scale-check
5 full grain tank loads. Compare the wet weight of each load to the
measured scale weight for the same load.

To find the wet
weight of each load on the CommandCenterCommandCenter is a trademark of Deere
& Company™ display.

each of the 5 loads.


8. Calculate the difference
between the wet weight of each load determined by the machine and
the measured scale weight of each load as a percentage.

To calculate the difference as a percentage:


9. Wet Weight - Scale Weight
= Difference


10. Difference ÷ Scale Weight
x 100 = Offset Correction Value (as a percentage)


11. Repeat this calculation
for the remaining 4 loads.


12. Calculate the average
offset correction value of the 5 loads:


13. Offset Correction Value
1 + Offset Correction Value 2 + Offset Correction Value 3 + Offset
Correction Value 4 + Offset Correction Value 5 = Total


14. Total ÷ 5 = Average Offset
Correction Value (as a percentage)


15. 

Correction Value

### Header Suspension Service Mode

**CAUTION**: There is stored hydraulic energy on the header even
when the header is not running and not attached to a combine. Service
of the suspension system requires discharging of the system via the
header suspension service mode. Follow the instructions to ensure
that the system is completely discharged prior to service.


This procedure can be used to release hydraulic pressure from
the hinged draper suspension systems. Releasing hydraulic load makes
service and maintenance possible and can be controlled for either
wing of the header.

- You want to set the maximum operating speed.
- You do not want the machine running over a specific speed
because the terrain is rough or feeding conditions exist that could
plug the header.
- You want to prevent the machine from going too fast through
places in the field where there is little to no crop. This results
in the machine going too fast when crop yields return to normal. Set
the speed limit slightly higher than the expected harvesting speed.

### Separator Losses

Separator Losses are loose kernels that leave the machine through
the discharge/overshot beater. A large amount of free grain at the
rear of the grain return pan is an indicator.

**How to Determine:**

- View Separator Losses on the VisionTrak display.
- Perform Power Shutdown, refer to Operator's Manual
for more information.


### Shoe Losses

**NOTE**: Always measure the losses in normal working conditions.
Measure losses over the complete working width several times. If swathing
straw, also measure where the chaff is spread.


Shoe Losses is grain that has exited the machine through the
cleaning shoe, either by air current or by contact with the chaffer.

**How to Determine:**

- View cleaning Shoe Losses on the VisionTrak display.
- Perform Power Shutdown, refer to Operator's Manual
for more information.


### Unthreshed Losses

Unthreshed Losses is grain on the ground that remains attached
to cob, grain head, or pod.

**How to Determine:**

- Perform a power shutdown, refer to Operator's Manual for
more information.
- Inspect the processed material on the ground behind the
machine.


### Broken Grain

Broken Grain is damaged or broken grain in the grain tank.

**How to Determine:**

- View the grain tank and inspect the grain sample.


### Light Foreign Material

Light Foreign Material is pieces of light and fluffy material
in the grain tank with the clean grain. These pieces are something
that you would expect air to blow away.

**How to Determine:**

- View the grain tank and inspect the grain sample.


### Heavy Foreign Material

Heavy Foreign Material is pieces of cob or short sections of
stem/stalk in the grain tank with the clean grain. These pieces are
something that you would not expect air to blow away.

**How to Determine:**

- View the grain tank and inspect the grain sample.


### Unthreshed Material

Unthreshed Material is grain in the grain tank remaining attached
to cob, grain head, or pod.

**How to Determine:**

- View the grain tank and inspect the grain sample.


### Straw Quality Issues

Windrow mode only. Straw is excessively broken, too short, or
tangled.

**How to Determine:**

- Inspect straw windrow.


### Excess Tailings

**NOTE**: Properly set machines have some tailings volume.


Tailings volume is high enough to cause tailings full alarm
or higher than expected by operator.

**How to Determine:**

- View tailings on the VisionTrak display.
- Check composition of tailings:
- A high amount of free grain in tailings can indicate sieve
clearance is too low.
- Unthreshed kernels can indicate a threshing issue.
- High tailings volume with only chaff can indicate high
chaff load on the cleaning shoe.


### Solutions

**NOTE**: Solutions that require you to adjust settings manually,
or climb out of the cab, have a slightly different appearance within
the Solutions multi-pane toggle view. The "hand icon", "Manual"

Separator Tine

ACap Screw
BCap Screw

Rotor is a balanced assembly. Elements and tines must be
replaced in sets of three to maintain balance. Replacement kits are
available through service parts and include new cap screws with pre-applied
thread lock and sealer. Tines or elements that become loose may result
in machine damage.

If tines or elements need to be removed
for reasons other than replacement, mark location on tines/elements
and rotor prior to removal. Install in same location as removed to
maintain balance. Always use new cap screws.

Make sure
to clean out tailings and front cross auger if tine replacement is
due to broken or damaged tines. Failure to do so before initial start-up
may allow broken tines to recirculate and cause tine damage to reoccur.

### Chaffer and Sieve—Measuring

#### Louver Length



Chaffer/Sieve Louver Length

AWire-to-Wire

Machines can be equipped with two different types of chaffer
and sieves.

- Deep-tooth chaffer and sieve
- Chaffer 41 mm (1-5/8 in)
- Sieve 30 mm (1-3/16 in)
- General-purpose chaffer and sieve
- Chaffer 30 mm (1-3/16 in)
- Sieve 30 mm (1-3/16 in)
- Flat-tooth comb chaffer and sieve
- Chaffer 30 mm (1-3/16 in)
- Sieve 30 mm (1-3/16 in)

Proper way to measure chaffer and sieve louver length is from
wire-to-wire (A) as shown. This can be used to determine if a deep-tooth,
general-purpose, or flat-tooth comb chaffer or sieve is installed.

#### Sieve Louver Depth



Sieve Louver Depth

ALouver Depth

Machines can be equipped with two different types of sieves.

- Deep-tooth sieve
- Sieve 22 mm (7/8 in)
- General-purpose sieve
- Sieve 10 mm (3/8 in)

Proper way to measure sieve louver depth (A) is from bottom
of louver to tip of louver as shown. This can be used to determine
if a deep-tooth or general-purpose sieve is installed.

#### Louver Clearance

**NOTE**: 

Chaffer/Sieve Louver Clearance

ALouver-to-Louver

Always close the chaffer/sieve louvers past the desired set
point and then open the louvers to the desired set point to remove
play.


Proper way to measure chaffer and sieve clearance is from louver-to-louver
(A) as shown. This can be used to determine if clearance on chaffer
and sieve matches with setting shown on armrest display.


### General-Purpose Chaffer 30 mm (1-3/16 in)

**NOTE**: 

General-Purpose Chaffer
Dimension shown is wire-to-wire spacing.


General-purpose chaffer is suitable for corn, soybeans, sorghum,
small grains, oil seed crops, grass seed, and many specialty crops.
It is recommended for dry conditions and is resistant to “stabbing”
of corn tassels and soybean, sunflower, and sorghum stems.


### Deep-Tooth Chaffer 41 mm (1-5/8 in)

**NOTE**: 

Deep-Tooth Chaffer
Dimension shown is wire-to-wire spacing.

Not
recommended for use in small grains, food corn, or popcorn.


Deep-tooth chaffer and deep-tooth sieve provide additional grain
separation capacity in high moisture and high yield corn and high-capacity
and clean grain sample in corn and soybeans.


### Flat-Tooth Comb Chaffer 30 mm (1-3/16 in)

**NOTE**: 

Flat-Tooth Comb Chaffer
Dimension shown is wire-to-wire spacing.

The
flat-tooth comb chaffer requires a 2—3 mm wider chaffer clearance
opening and 50 rpm higher fan speed compared to the general-purpose
chaffer.


The flat-tooth comb chaffer improves tailings volume and grain
tank sample, especially in challenging conditions (weedy conditions
and heavily bearded crops), such as canola, oil seed (rape), and lentils.
The curled chaffer finger reduces the amount of longer sticks passing
through the chaffer.


### General Purpose Sieve 30 mm (1-3/16 in)

**NOTE**: 

Sieve
Dimension shown is wire-to-wire spacing.


This sieve is suitable for all major crops and many specialty
crops.


### Deep-Tooth Sieve 30 mm (1-3/16 in)

**NOTE**: 

Deep Tooth Sieve
Dimension shown is wire-to-wire spacing.

Not
recommended for use in small grains, food corn, or popcorn.


Deep-tooth sieve provides additional grain separation in high-moisture
and high-yield corn.

This sieve together with the deep-tooth chaffer provides high-capacity
and clean grain samples in corn and soybeans.

### Service Tires Safely

**CAUTION**: Explosive separation of a tire and rim parts can cause
serious injury or death.

Do not attempt to mount a tire
unless you have the proper equipment and experience to perform the
job.


![Explosive Tire and Rim Parts]
*Explosive Tire and Rim Parts*

Always maintain the correct tire pressure. Do not inflate the
tires above the recommended pressure. 

Never weld or heat a wheel and tire assembly. The heat can cause
an increase in air pressure resulting in a tire explosion. Welding
can structurally weaken or deform the wheel.

When inflating tires, use a clip-on chuck and extension hose
long enough to allow you to stand to one side and NOT in front of
or over the tire assembly. Use a safety cage if available.

Check wheels for low pressure, cuts, bubbles, damaged rims or
missing lug bolts and nuts.


### Tire Loading Decal



Tire Loading Decal

ADecal

Decal (A) (located on cab ladder) contains important information
concerning tire loading.


### Care and Service of Tires

**IMPORTANT**: Installing tires that do not meet original equipment
tire specifications may cause machine malfunction. Consult your dealer
or tire supplier for guidance.

Use of substandard tires
or larger than recommended tires will void warranty and may decrease
stability, affect steering, result in premature tire failure, or cause
other durability or safety issues.


**IMPORTANT**: A permanent repair should be made as soon as possible
to prevent further tire damage.


Check tires daily for damage or noticeably low pressure.

At least every 100 hours of operation, check tire pressure.
If tires contain liquid ballast, use a special air-water gauge and
measure with valve stem at bottom.

A small puncture in a tubeless tire can be temporarily repaired
without dismounting the tire, thus avoiding down time during a busy
season.

Protect tires from exposure to sunlight, petroleum products,
and chemicals.

Drive carefully. Try to avoid rocks and sharp objects.


### Basic Tire Information

#### Diagonal Tire (Bias)

![Diagonal Tire (Bias)]
*Diagonal Tire (Bias)*

The diagonal tire (bias) is identified by conventional nomenclature.

#### Radial Tire

![Radial Tire (Conventional Nomenclature)]
*Radial Tire (Conventional Nomenclature)*

The radial tire can be identified by conventional nomenclature
or international system.

**Conventional nomenclature**



Radial Tire (International System)
**International system**

#### High Flotation Tire

![High Flotation Tire]
*High Flotation Tire*

The high flotation tires are identified by a mixed nomenclature.


### Tire Tread Types

**NOTE**: 

Tire Tread Types
Tire tread shape varies depending on tire manufacture.


There are three types of tread and these are the most used on
agricultural application.


### Front Tire Pressure

**IMPORTANT**: All road transportation MUST be done at pressure
shown in No Head/Transport column. Improper pressure during transport
may decrease vehicle stability. Proper pressure results in better
fuel economy and longer tire life.

### Rear Tire Pressure

**IMPORTANT**: All road transportation MUST be done at pressure
shown in No Head/Transport column. Improper pressure during transport
may decrease vehicle stability. Proper pressure results in better
fuel economy and longer tire life.

### Front and Rear Tire Information

**IMPORTANT**: When changing drive wheels, tire radius may also
change. POD control unit MUST be set to the new tire radius. See your
John Deere dealer for further information on changing the tire codes.

Failure to calibrate system results in inaccurate Harvest Monitor
Yields.


If tires or final drives are changed from what was originally
shipped from the factory, it is necessary to recalibrate the system.

### Using Liquid Weight

**CAUTION**: 

Valve Stem
Installing liquid weight (ballast) requires special equipment
and training.


**NOTE**: Use of alcohol as liquid ballast is not recommended. Calcium
chloride solution is heavier and more economical.


A solution of water and calcium chloride provides a safe and
economical ballast. Used properly, it will not damage tires, tubes,
or rims.

Use calcium chloride to prevent water from freezing. A mixture
of 1.6 kg (3-1/2 lb) of calcium chloride per 3.8 L (1 gal) will not
freeze solid above -45°C (-50°F).

Fill tubeless tires at least to valve level (minimum 75% full).
Less solution would expose part of rim, possibly causing corrosion.
Tube-type tires may be filled to any level below 90%.


### Ballast Requirements

**NOTE**: Ballast requirements vary based on configuration.

Ballast requirements are based off standard Corn Pricing configuration,
133 L (35 gal) fuel in tank, and full grain tank. This may not reflect
all scenarios.

Tires requiring fluid must be filled to
75%.

### Tow Loads Safely



32 km/h (20 mph) Maximum Transport Speed while
Towing
Stopping distance increases with speed and weight of towed
loads and on slopes. Towed loads that are too heavy for the combine
or are towed too fast can cause loss of control. Consider the total
weight of the equipment and its load.

Do not exceed maximum towing capacity of 8000 kg (17 637 lb).

Do not transport at speed exceeding 32 km/h (20 mph) while towing.

Use additional caution and reduce speed when towing under adverse
surface conditions, when turning, and on inclines.

## Harvesting Hints

### Operation at Low Temperatures

**IMPORTANT**: When operating in cold temperatures, verify that
proper grade diesel fuel is being used. Warmer grade diesel fuel will
gel in fuel lines, fuel filters, and fuel tank. Fuel system requires
servicing if diesel fuel gels. See Fuels and Lubricants section for
further information.


Combine functions can degrade in low temperatures where snow
and ice are present. Special care MUST be taken to ensure that minimal
snow is ingested in combine. If snow is ingested, areas such as chaffer,
cleaning fan, separator concaves, and separator grates can become
obstructed. Operation with these areas obstructed could cause machine
damage and significant repairs or result in functional performance
degradation. Consult your John Deere dealer prior to operating in
cold temperatures.


### Harvesting Tips

Adjust machine to crop being harvested and to field conditions.

Select a ground speed that does not overload machine. Engine
must be at full rpm to keep separator at full speed. Select a ground
speed for slower travel, but do not slow engine speed.

If the concave is set too close for the harvested crop, straw
will be excessively ground up requiring more horsepower to thresh
the crop.

If the concave is set too wide for the harvested crop, it will
not be completely threshed.

After threshing clearance is adjusted properly, adjust separator
speed to achieve maximum threshing with the least amount of crop damage.
If crop damage does occur, reduce feed accelerator speed. Threshing
clearance in these crops has very little effect on seed damage.

Crops such as edible beans and peas are easily cracked and can
require the use of a slower feed accelerator drive. When harvesting
edible beans and peas keep machine full to provide enough material
to cushion the crop against cracking.

For potential improvements in straw quality consider that the
following can help improve straw quality depending on conditions:

For improved performance in sidehill conditions, consider trying
the following:

Each of these actions can improve the chaff and grain distribution
to the cleaning shoe, resulting in improved performance in sidehill
conditions.

When using a cutting platform, cut crop as high as possible
without loss of low heads. Adjust reel position and speed for even
feeding. Keep cutterbar in register and guards in alignment for clean
cutting.

When harvesting corn, keep corn head only as low as necessary
for ears. Keep it centered in the rows to prevent ear loss.

When using a belt pickup, keep windrow centered so material
is fed evenly into the feeder house. Grain heads must be lying in
one direction. Operate machine so heads are picked up first.

When harvesting soybeans with a row-crop head, keep header as
low as possible. When harvesting crops such as milo or sunflowers,
operate header just low enough to cut the heads from the stalks.

Adjust chaffer openings to pass grain or seed to the lower sieve
in the first two-thirds of the chaffer without admitting too much
coarse material.

Use as much air as possible without blowing over clean grain
and seed. Heavy crops require more air than light seed crops.

- Slowing feeder house chain speed
- Slowing feed accelerator speed
- Slowing rotor speed
- Opening concave
- Reducing threshing elements
- Installing round bar concaves

- Adjust the position of the angled dividers on the front
step pan to improve shoe distribution.
- Install tall chaffer dividers (available from your John
Deere dealer).
- Install separator grate covers (if equipped) to improve
the chaff and grain distribution.

### Change Tire Radius Code

**IMPORTANT**: When changing drive wheels, tire radius may also
change. POD control unit MUST be set to the new tire radius. See your
John Deere dealer for further information on changing the tire codes.

Failure to calibrate system results in inaccurate Harvest MonitorHarvest Monitor is a trademark of Deere & Company™ Yields.


If tires or final drives are changed from what was originally
shipped from the factory, it is necessary to recalibrate the system.


### Single Point Yield Calibration Or Multi-Point Yield Calibration

**NOTE**: 

Speed Variations

Crop Flow Variations

ALoad 1
BLoad 2
CLoad 3
DLoad 4
EMinimum Flow
FMedium Flow
GMedium Flow
HMaximum Flow

Varying machine ground speed is the best way to vary the
flow rate.

The best way to keep the flow rate constant
is to monitor the VisionTrakVisionTrak is a trademark of Deere & Company™ display and adjust machine ground speed accordingly.


#### Single Point Yield Calibration

Single point yield calibration is performed when one or up to
three calibration loads are collected.

This type of calibration is suggested when the harvested field
has a fairly consistent yield and machine is operated at a constant
ground speed with little flow variation.

To collect a calibration load, harvest approximately 2722 kg
(6000 lb) at the maximum harvest speed.

Running one or two additional loads is not required, but it
may allow the system to average the overall error.

#### Multi-Point Yield Calibration

Multi-point yield calibration is used when the harvested field
is expected to have varying yields or machine is operated at varying
speeds with varying grain flows.

This type of calibration collects each calibration load at each
expected flow condition.

For each calibration load, harvest approximately 2722 kg (6000
lb).

Run at least **four** calibration loads
over various ground speeds (A—D) or at different cut widths to simulate
four different flow rates (E—H).

### Power Shutdown Procedure

1. **NOTE**: A power shutdown is used to determine the machine’s performance
in the threshing and separating areas by taking a "snapshot"
of the material in the separator. This is valuable in determining
where the losses behind the machine are generated and what adjustments
can be made to correct the condition.

Verify that crop
condition and material intake is similar for each shutdown.

be identified by the smell of smoke or sight of flames. Because fire
grows and spreads rapidly, get off the machine immediately and move
safely away from the fire. Do not return to the machine! The number
one priority is safety.

Call the fire department. A portable fire extinguisher can put
out a small fire or contain it until the fire department arrives;
but portable extinguishers have limitations. Always put the safety
of the operator and bystanders first. If attempting to extinguish
a fire, keep your back to the wind with an unobstructed escape path
so you can move away quickly if the fire cannot be extinguished.

Read the fire extinguisher instructions and become familiar
with their location, parts, and operation before a fire starts. Local
fire departments or fire equipment distributors may offer fire extinguisher
training and recommendations.

If your extinguisher does not have instructions, follow these
general guidelines:

1. Pull the pin. Hold the
extinguisher with the nozzle pointing away from you, and release the
locking mechanism. 


2. Aim low. Point the extinguisher
at the base of the fire.


3. Squeeze the lever slowly
and evenly.


4. Sweep the nozzle from
side-to-side.




### Cleaning Engine Compartment

**CAUTION**: 

Clean Engine Compartment
Do not clean engine or engine compartment with engine running.
Dirt, oil, chaff, and crop debris in engine compartment and on engine
is a fire hazard. Direction of wind, type of crop, and crop moisture
content can all have an effect on where and how much chaff and debris
accumulate. Check and clean this area frequently.



## Machine Cleanout

### General Cleaning Guidelines

**IMPORTANT**: Regular and thorough cleaning of machine combined
with other routine maintenance procedures listed in the Operator’s
Manual greatly reduce the risk of fire, chance of costly downtime,
and improve machine performance.

Crop material and other
debris can accumulate in various areas. Direction of wind, type of
crop, and crop moisture content can all impact where and how much
crop material and debris can accumulate. Be aware of harvest conditions
and adjust your cleaning schedule to ensure proper machine function
and to reduce the risk of fire. Inspect and clean these areas as needed
throughout the harvest day.


Machine must be inspected periodically throughout the harvest
day. Buildup of crop material and other debris must be removed to
ensure proper machine function and to reduce the risk of fire. Frequency
of inspections and cleanings vary depending on a number of factors,
including operating conditions, machine settings, crop conditions,
operating speeds, and weather conditions. Inspections and cleanings
may be required multiple times throughout the harvest day, particularly
in dry, hot, and windy conditions. Wet crop conditions can also pose
a fire risk under some circumstances.

Harvesting certain crops can cause special issues. Some crops
are very “sticky” and it is often more difficult to clean the machine
when harvesting these crops. Examples of these crops include, but
are not limited to sunflower, canola, and safflower. Take special
care in cleaning the machine when harvesting these types of crops.

Always follow all safety procedures posted on the machine and
in the Operator’s Manual. Before carrying out any inspection or cleaning,
always shut OFF engine, set park brake, and remove key.

### Cleaning Out Machine (Periodic Cleanout)

**IMPORTANT**: These areas may require more frequent cleaning, even
multiple times per day, depending on harvest conditions. Be aware
of harvest conditions and adjust your cleaning schedule to ensure
proper machine function and to reduce the risk of fire.

Other areas not covered in this section may also collect crop debris
and MUST be cleaned periodically for machine function and appearance.
Thoroughly inspect the entire machine on a regular basis throughout
the harvest season.


**NOTE**: Some shields were removed for photo clarity.


The photographs in this section show areas of the machine that
require regular inspection and cleaning. While there are other areas
that require regular cleaning, frequent attention to these areas provides
the greatest impact on fire prevention.

Some of these photographs show accumulations of crop material
and other debris prior to cleaning. This type of accumulation is not
normal; it was allowed for illustrative purposes only.

Before carrying out any inspection or cleaning, always shut
OFF engine, set park brake, and remove key.

Thoroughly clean machine from top to bottom with compressed
air. First, clean all areas accessible from the engine deck. Panels
or covers may need to be removed or opened to access areas for cleaning.
Start with engine compartment and work outwards and counterclockwise
to other areas around engine compartment, floor underneath engine,
top rear of rotor, and rear deck, including areas around exhaust aftertreatment
enclosure (if equipped). Once top areas of machine are clean, proceed
to cleaning areas accessible from the ground level.

From the ground level, clean rear underside of fuel tank area
and top of the rear tailboard of the residue disposal system. Once
the cleaning from the ground level is finished, recheck engine compartment
for any crop debris that could have blown in from the ground level

## Fuels and Lubricants

### Handle Fuel Safely—Avoid Fires

![Avoid Fires]
*Avoid Fires*

Handle fuel with care: it is highly flammable. Do not refuel
the machine while smoking or when near open flame or sparks.

Always stop engine before refueling machine. Fill fuel tank
outdoors.

Prevent fires by keeping machine clean of accumulated trash,
grease, and debris. Always clean up spilled fuel.

Use only an approved fuel container for transporting flammable
liquids.

Never fill fuel container in pickup truck with plastic bed liner.
Always place fuel container on ground before refueling. Touch fuel
container with fuel dispenser nozzle before removing can lid. Keep
fuel dispenser nozzle in contact with fuel container inlet when filling.

Do not store fuel container where there is an open flame, spark,
or pilot light such as within a water heater or other appliance.


### Avoid Static Electricity Risk When Refueling

![Explosion]
![Explosion]
*Explosion*

The removal of sulfur and other compounds in Ultra-Low Sulfur
Diesel (ULSD) fuel decreases its conductivity and increases its ability
to store a static charge.

Refineries may have treated the fuel with a static dissipating
additive. However, there are many factors that can reduce the effectiveness
of the additive over time.

Static charges can build up in ULSD fuel while it is flowing
through fuel delivery systems. Static electricity discharge when combustible
vapors are present could result in a fire or explosion.

Therefore, it is important to ensure that the entire system
used to refuel your machine (fuel supply tank, transfer pump, transfer
hose, nozzle, and others) is properly grounded and bonded. Consult
with your fuel or fuel system supplier to ensure that the delivery
system is in compliance with fueling standards for proper grounding
and bonding practices.


### Fuel Tank—Filling

**CAUTION**: 

Fuel Tank Cap

AFuel Tank

Handle fuel carefully. Do not refuel machine while smoking.
Shut OFF engine, set park brake, and remove key before filling fuel
tank. 

Do not overfill fuel tank. Bodily injury can result
from fuel splash back. Leakage can result from expansion of fuel.
If fuel tank is too full and left in direct sunlight, or the temperature
is allowed to get too hot, fuel tank will overflow.


Fill fuel tank (A) at end of each day. This prevents condensation
in the fuel tank as moist air cools.

### Handling and Storing Diesel Fuel

**CAUTION**: Reduce the risk of fire. Handle fuel carefully. DO
NOT fill the fuel tank when engine is running. DO NOT smoke while
you fill the fuel tank or service the fuel system.


Fill the fuel tank at the end of each day's operation to prevent
water condensation and freezing during cold weather.

Keep all storage tanks as full as practicable to minimize condensation.

Ensure that all fuel tank caps and covers are installed properly
to prevent moisture from entering. Monitor water content of the fuel
regularly.

When using BioDiesel fuel, the fuel filter may require more
frequent replacement due to premature plugging.

Check engine oil level daily prior to starting engine. A rising
oil level may indicate fuel dilution of the engine oil.	

When fuel is stored for an extended period or if there is a
slow turnover of fuel, add a fuel conditioner to stabilize the fuel
and prevent water condensation. Contact your fuel supplier or John
Deere dealer for recommendations.


### Diesel Fuel

**IMPORTANT**: Do not mix used diesel engine oil or any other type
of lubricating oil with diesel fuel.

Improper fuel additive
usage may cause damage on fuel injection equipment of diesel engines.


Consult your local fuel distributor for properties of the diesel
fuel available in your area.

In general, diesel fuels are blended to satisfy the low temperature
requirements of the geographical area in which they are marketed.

Diesel fuels specified to EN 590 or ASTM D975 are recommended.
Renewable diesel fuel produced by hydrotreating animal fats and vegetable
oils is basically identical to petroleum diesel fuel. Renewable diesel
that meets EN 590, ASTM D975, or EN 15940 is acceptable for use at
all percentage mixture levels.

#### Required Fuel Properties

In all cases, the fuel shall meet the following properties: 

**Cetane number of 40 minimum.** Cetane
number greater than 47 is preferred, especially for temperatures below
–20 °C (–4 °F) or elevations above 1675 m (5500 ft.).

**Cloud Point** should be below the expected
lowest ambient temperature or **Cold Filter Plugging
Point** (CFPP) should be a maximum 10°C (18°F) below the fuel
cloud point.

**Fuel lubricity** should pass a maximum
scar diameter of 0.52 mm as measured by ASTM D6079 or ISO 12156-1.
A maximum scar diameter of 0.45 mm is preferred.

**Diesel fuel quality and sulfur content** must comply with all existing emissions regulations for the area
in which the engine operates. DO NOT use diesel fuel with sulfur content
greater than 10 000 mg/kg (10 000 ppm).

**Materials** such as copper, lead, zinc,
tin, brass and bronze should be avoided in fuel handling, distribution
and storage equipment as these metals can catalyze fuel oxidation
reactions which can lead to fuel system deposits and plugged fuel
filters.

#### E-Diesel fuel

DO NOT use E-Diesel (Diesel fuel and ethanol blend). Use of
E-Diesel fuel in any John Deere machine may void the machine warranty.

**CAUTION**: Avoid severe injury or death due to the fire and explosion
risk from using E-Diesel fuel.


#### Sulfur Content for Interim Tier 4, Final Tier 4, Stage III A
and B, Stage IV, and Stage V Engines Above 560 kW

- Use ONLY diesel fuel with a maximum of 500 mg/kg (500
ppm) sulfur content.

#### Sulfur Content for Interim Tier 4, Final Tier 4, Stage III B,
Stage IV Engines, and Stage V Engines

- Use ONLY ultra low sulfur diesel (ULSD) fuel with a maximum
of 15 mg/kg (15 ppm) sulfur content.

#### Sulfur Content for Tier 3 and Stage III A Engines

- Use of diesel fuel with sulfur content less than 1000
mg/kg (1000 ppm) is RECOMMENDED.
- Use of diesel fuel with sulfur content 1000—2000 mg/kg
(1000—2000 ppm) REDUCES the oil and filter change interval.

- BEFORE using diesel fuel with sulfur content greater than
2000 mg/kg (2000 ppm), contact your John Deere dealer.

#### Sulfur Content for Tier 2 and Stage II Engines

- Use of diesel fuel with sulfur content less than 2000
mg/kg (2000 ppm) is RECOMMENDED.
- Use of diesel fuel with sulfur content 2000—5000 mg/kg
(2000—5000 ppm) REDUCES the oil and filter change interval.See DX,ENOIL12,OEM, DX,ENOIL12,T2,STD, or DX,ENOIL12,T2,EXT
 for more information on Engine Oil and Filter Service Intervals.
- BEFORE using diesel fuel with sulfur content greater than
5000 mg/kg (5000 ppm), contact your John Deere dealer.

#### Sulfur Content for Other Engines

- Use of diesel fuel with sulfur content less than 5000
mg/kg (5000 ppm) is RECOMMENDED.
- Use of diesel fuel with sulfur content greater than 5000
mg/kg (5000 ppm) REDUCES the oil and filter change interval.


### Biodiesel Fuel

Biodiesel fuel is comprised of monoalkyl esters of long chain
fatty acids derived from vegetable oils or animal fats. Biodiesel
blends are biodiesel mixed with petroleum diesel fuel on a volume
basis.

Before using fuel containing biodiesel, review the Biodiesel
Use Requirements and Recommendations in this Operator’s Manual.

Environmental laws and regulations can encourage or prohibit
the use of biofuels. Operators should consult with appropriate governmental
authorities prior to using biofuels.

#### John Deere Stage V Engines Operating in the European Union

Where the engine is to be operated within the Union on diesel
or non-road gas-oil, a fuel with a FAME content not greater than 8%
volume/volume (B8) shall be used.

#### John Deere Engines with Exhaust Filter Except Stage V Engines
Operating in the European Union

Biodiesel blends up to B20 can be used ONLY if the biodiesel
(100% biodiesel or B100) meets ASTM D6751, EN 14214, or equivalent
specification. Expect a 2% reduction in power and a 3% reduction in
fuel economy when using B20.

Biodiesel concentrations above B20 can harm the engine’s emission
control systems and should not be used. Risks include, but are not
limited to, more frequent stationary regeneration, soot accumulation,
and increased intervals for ash removal.

John Deere Fuel conditioners or equivalent, which contain detergent
and dispersant additives, are required when using biodiesel blends
from B10 to B20, and are recommended when using lower biodiesel blends.

#### John Deere Engines Without Exhaust Filter

Biodiesel blends up to B20 can be used ONLY if the biodiesel
(100% biodiesel or B100) meets ASTM D6751, EN 14214, or equivalent
specification. Expect a 2% reduction in power and a 3% reduction in
fuel economy when using B20.

These John Deere engines can operate on biodiesel blends above
B20 (up to 100% biodiesel). Operate at levels above B20 ONLY if the
biodiesel is permitted by law and meets the EN 14214 specification
(primarily available in Europe). Engines operating on biodiesel blends
above B20 might not fully comply with or be permitted by all applicable
emissions regulations. Expect up to a 12% reduction in power and an
18% reduction in fuel economy when using 100% biodiesel.

John Deere fuel conditioners or equivalent, which contain detergent
and dispersant additives, are required when using biodiesel blends
from B10 to B100, and are recommended when using lower biodiesel blends.

#### Biodiesel Use Requirements and Recommendations

The petroleum diesel portion of all biodiesel blends must meet
the requirements of ASTM D975 (US) or EN 590 (EU) commercial standard.

Biodiesel users in the U.S. are strongly encouraged to purchase
biodiesel blends from a BQ-9000 Certified Marketer and sourced from
a BQ-9000 Accredited Producer (as certified by the National biodiesel
Board). Certified Marketers and Accredited Producers can be found
at the following website: http://www.bq9000.org.

Biodiesel contains residual ash. Ash levels exceeding the maximums
allowed in either ASTM D6751 or EN14214 can result in more rapid ash
loading and require more frequent cleaning of the Exhaust Filter (if
present).

The fuel filter can require more frequent replacement when using
biodiesel fuel, particularly if switching from diesel. Check engine
oil level daily prior to starting engine. A rising oil level can indicate
fuel dilution of the engine oil. Biodiesel blends up to B20 must be
used within 90 days of the date of biodiesel manufacture. Biodiesel
blends above B20 must be used within 45 days from the date of biodiesel
manufacture.

When using biodiesel blends up to B20, the following must be
considered:

- Cold-weather flow degradation
- Stability and storage issues (moisture absorption, microbial
growth)
- Possible filter restriction and plugging (usually a problem
when first switching to biodiesel on used engines)
- Possible fuel leakage through seals and hoses (primarily
an issue with older engines)
- Possible reduction of service life of engine components

Request a certificate of analysis from your fuel distributor
to ensure that the fuel is compliant with the specifications provided
in this Operator’s Manual.

Consult your John Deere dealer for John Deere fuel products
to improve storage and performance with biodiesel fuels.

The following must also be considered if using biodiesel blends
above B20:

- Possible coking or blocked injector nozzles, resulting
in power loss and engine misfire if John Deere fuel additives and
conditioners or equivalent containing detergent/dispersants are not
used
- Possible crankcase oil dilution (requiring more frequent
oil changes)
- Possible lacquering or seizure of internal components
- Possible formation of sludge and sediments
- Possible thermal oxidation of fuel at elevated temperatures
- Possible compatibility issues with other materials (including
copper, lead, zinc, tin, brass, and bronze) used in fuel handling,
distribution, and storage equipment
- Possible reduction in water separator efficiency
- Possible damage to paint if exposed to biodiesel
- Possible corrosion of fuel injection equipment
- Possible elastomeric seal and gasket material degradation
(primarily an issue with older engines)
- Possible high acid levels within fuel system
- Because biodiesel blends above B20 contain more ash, using
blends above B20 can result in more rapid ash loading and require
more frequent cleaning of the Exhaust Filter (if present)

**IMPORTANT**: Raw pressed vegetable oils are NOT acceptable for
use as fuel in any concentration in John Deere engines. Their use
could cause engine failure.



### Lubricity of Diesel Fuel

**IMPORTANT**: Make sure the diesel fuel used in your machine demonstrates
good lubricity characteristics.


Most diesel fuels manufactured in the United States, Canada,
and the European Union have adequate lubricity to ensure proper operation
and durability of fuel injection system components. However, diesel
fuels manufactured in some areas of the world may lack the necessary
lubricity.

Fuel lubricity should pass a maximum scar diameter of 0.52 mm
as measured by ASTM D6079 or ISO 12156-1. A maximum scar diameter
of 0.45 mm is preferred.

If fuel of low or unknown lubricity is used, add John Deere
Fuel-Protect Diesel Fuel Conditioner (or equivalent) at the specified
concentration.

**Lubricity of BioDiesel Fuel**

Fuel lubricity can improve significantly with BioDiesel blends
up to B20 (20% BioDiesel). Further increase in lubricity is limited
for BioDiesel blends greater than B20.


### Supplemental Diesel Fuel Additives

Diesel fuel can be the source of performance or other operational
problems for many reasons. Some causes include poor lubricity, contaminants,
low cetane number, and a variety of properties that cause fuel system
deposits. These and others are referenced in other sections of this
Operator's Manual.

To optimize engine performance and reliability, closely follow
recommendations on fuel quality, storage, and handling, which are
found elsewhere in this Operator's Manual.

To further aid in maintaining performance and reliability of
the engine's fuel system, John Deere has developed a family of fuel
additive products for most global markets. The primary products include
Fuel-Protect Diesel Fuel Conditioner (full feature conditioner in
winter and summer formulas) and Fuel-Protect Keep Clean (fuel injector
deposit removal and prevention). Availability of these and other products
varies by market. See your local John Deere dealer for availability
and additional information about fuel additives that might be right
for your needs.


### Testing Diesel Fuel

A fuel analysis program can help to monitor the quality of diesel
fuel. The fuel analysis can provide critical data such as calculated
cetane index, fuel type, sulfur content, water content, appearance,
suitability for cold weather operations, bacteria, cloud point, acid
number, particulate contamination, and whether the fuel meets ASTM
D975 or equivalent specification.

Contact your John Deere dealer for more information on diesel
fuel analysis.


### Minimizing the Effect of Cold Weather on Diesel Engines

John Deere diesel engines are designed to operate effectively
in cold weather.

However, for effective starting and cold-weather operation,
a little extra care is necessary. The following information outlines
steps that can minimize the effect that cold weather may have on starting
and operation of your engine. See your John Deere dealer for additional
information and local availability of cold-weather aids.

#### Use Winter Grade Fuel

When temperatures fall below 0°C (32°F), winter grade fuel (No.
1-D in North America) is best suited for cold-weather operation. Winter
grade fuel has a lower cloud point and a lower pour point.

**Cloud point** is the temperature at
which wax begins to form in the fuel. This wax causes fuel filters
to plug. **Pour point** is the lowest temperature
at which movement of the fuel is observed.

**NOTE**: On average, winter grade diesel fuel has a lower Btu (heat
content) rating. Using winter grade fuel may reduce power and fuel
efficiency, but should not cause any other engine performance effects.
Check the grade of fuel being used before troubleshooting for low-power
complaints in cold-weather operation.


#### Air Intake Heater

An air intake heater is an available option for some engines
to aid cold weather starting.

#### Ether

An ether port on the intake is available to aid cold weather
starting.

**CAUTION**: Ether is highly flammable. Do not use ether when starting
an engine equipped with glow plugs or an air intake heater.


#### Coolant Heater

An engine block heater (coolant heater) is an available option
to aid cold weather starting.

#### Seasonal Viscosity Oil and Proper Coolant Concentration

Use seasonal grade viscosity engine oil based on the expected
air temperature range between oil changes and a proper concentration
of low silicate antifreeze as recommended. (See DIESEL ENGINE OIL
and ENGINE COOLANT requirements in this section.)

#### Diesel Fuel Cold Flow Additive

Use John Deere Fuel-Protect Diesel Fuel Conditioner (winter
formula), which contains anti-gel chemistry, or equivalent fuel conditioner
to treat non-winter grade fuel (No. 2-D in North America) during the
cold-weather season. This generally extends operability to about 10°C
(18°F) below the fuel cloud point. For operability at even lower temperatures,
use winter grade fuel.

**IMPORTANT**: Treat fuel when outside temperature drops below 0°C
(32°F). For best results, use with untreated fuel. Follow all recommended
instructions on label.


#### Biodiesel

When operating with biodiesel blends, wax formation can occur
at warmer temperatures. Begin using John Deere Fuel-Protect Diesel
Fuel Conditioner (winter formula) or equivalent at 5°C (41°F) to treat
biodiesel fuels during the cold-weather season. Use B5 or lower blends
at temperatures below 0°C (32°F). Use only winter grade petroleum
diesel fuel at temperatures below -10°C (14°F).

#### Winterfronts

Use of fabric, cardboard, or solid winterfronts is not recommended
with any John Deere engine. Their use can result in excessive engine
coolant, oil, and charge air temperatures. This can lead to reduced
engine life, loss of power and poor fuel economy. Winterfronts may
also put abnormal stress on fan and fan drive components potentially
causing premature failures.

If winterfronts are used, they should never totally close off
the grill frontal area. Approximately 25% area in the center of the
grill should remain open at all times. At no time should the air blockage
device be applied directly to the radiator core.

#### Radiator Shutters

If equipped with a thermostatically controlled radiator shutter
system, this system should be regulated in such a way that the shutters
are completely open by the time the coolant reaches 93°C (200°F) to
prevent excessive intake manifold temperatures. Manually controlled
systems are not recommended.

If air-to-air aftercooling is used, the shutters must be completely
open by the time the intake manifold air temperature reaches the maximum
allowable temperature out of the charge air cooler.

For more information, see your John Deere dealer.


### Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) — Use in Selective Catalytic Reduction
(SCR) Equipped Engines

![API Certification Symbol]
*API Certification Symbol*

In order to maintain the emissions performance of the engine,
it is essential to use and refill DEF in accordance with the specification.

Diesel exhaust fluid (DEF) is a high purity liquid that is injected
into the exhaust system of engines equipped with selective catalytic
reduction (SCR) systems. Maintaining the purity of DEF is important
to avoid malfunctions in the SCR system. Engines requiring DEF shall
use a product that meets the requirements for aqueous urea solution
32 (AUS 32) according to ISO 22241-1.

The use of John Deere Diesel Exhaust Fluid is recommended. John Deere
Diesel Exhaust Fluid is available at your John Deere dealer in a variety
of package sizes to suit your operational needs.

If John Deere Diesel Exhaust Fluid is not available, use DEF
that is certified by the American Petroleum Institute (API) Diesel
Exhaust Fluid Certification Program or by the AdBlueAdBlue is a trademark
of VDA, the German Association of the Automotive Industry.™ Diesel Exhaust Fluid Certification Program. Look for
the API certification symbol or the AdBlue™ name on the container.

### Testing Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF)

**IMPORTANT**: Using DEF with the correct concentration is critical
to engine and aftertreatment system performance. Extended storage
and other conditions can adversely alter the DEF concentration.


If DEF quality is questionable, draw a sample out of the DEF
tank or storage tank into a clear container. DEF must be crystal clear
with a light ammonia smell. If DEF appears cloudy, has a colored tint,
or has a profound ammonia smell, it is likely not within specification.
DEF in this condition should not be used. Drain tank, flush with distilled
water and refill with new or good DEF. After refilling the tank, check
the DEF concentration.

If the DEF passes the visual and smell test, check the DEF concentration
with a handheld refractometer calibrated to measure DEF.

DEF concentration should be checked when the engine has been
stored for extended periods, or if there is suspicion the engine or
packaged DEF fluid has been contaminated with water.

Follow instructions included with either tool to obtain the
measurement.

The correct DEF concentration is 31.8—33.2% urea. If the DEF
concentration is not within specification, drain the DEF tank, flush
with distilled water and fill with new or good DEF. If packaged DEF
is not within specification, dispose of DEF packages and replace with
new or good DEF.

### Storing Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF)

**CAUTION**: Avoid contact with eyes. In case of contact, immediately
flush eyes with large amounts of water for a minimum of 15 minutes.
Reference the Materials Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for additional information.

Do not ingest DEF. In the event DEF is ingested, contact a physician
immediately. Reference the Materials Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for
additional information.


Storage information provided below is for reference and is to
be used as a guideline only.

It is preferred to store DEF out of extreme ambient temperatures.
DEF freezes at –11°C (12°F). Exposure to temperatures greater than
30°C (86°F) can degrade DEF over time. Do not store DEF in direct
sunlight.

Dedicated DEF storage containers must be sealed between uses
to prevent evaporation and contamination. Containers made of polyethylene,
polypropylene, or stainless steel are recommended to transport and
store DEF. 

Under these conditions, DEF is expected to remain useable for
a minimum of 18 months. Storing DEF at higher temperatures can reduce
its useful life by approximately 6 months for every 5°C (9°F) temperature
above 30°C (86°F).

If unsure how long or under what conditions DEF has been stored,
test DEF. See Testing Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF).

Long-term storage in the DEF tank (over 12 months) is not recommended.
If long-term storage is necessary, test DEF prior to operating engine.
See Testing Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF).

It is recommended to purchase DEF in quantities that will be
consumed within 12 months.

- Store at temperatures between –5°C and 30°C (23°F and
86°F)
- Store in dedicated containers sealed to avoid contamination
and evaporation

*DEF Symbol*

Reasonable care should be taken when refilling the DEF tank.
Ensure that the DEF tank cap area is free of debris before removing
the cap. Seal containers of DEF between use to prevent contamination
and evaporation.

Avoid splashing DEF and do not allow DEF to come into contact
with skin, eyes, or mouth.

DEF is not harmful to handle, but DEF can be corrosive to materials
such as steel, iron, zinc, nickel, copper, aluminum, and magnesium.
Use suitable containers to transport and store DEF. Containers made
of polyethylene, polypropylene, or stainless steel are recommended.

Avoid prolonged contact with skin. In case of accidental contact,
wash skin immediately with soap and water.

Keep anything used to store or dispense DEF clean of dirt and
dust. Wash and rinse containers or funnels thoroughly with distilled
water to remove contaminants.

If an unapproved fluid, such as diesel fuel or coolant is added
to the DEF tank, contact your John Deere dealer immediately to determine
how to clean and purge the system.

If water has been added to the DEF tank, a tank cleaning is
necessary. See Cleaning DEF Tank in this manual. After refilling the
tank, check the DEF concentration. See Testing Diesel Exhaust Fluid
(DEF).

The operator must maintain appropriate DEF levels at all times.
Check the DEF level daily and refill the tank as needed. The filling
port is identified by a blue colored cap embossed with the following
DEF symbol.


### Disposal of Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF)

Although there is little issue with minor spillage of DEF on
the ground, large amounts of DEF should be contained. If large spills
occur, contact local environmental authorities for assistance with
clean-up.

If a substantial quantity of DEF is not within specification,
contact the DEF supplier for assistance with disposal. Do not dump
substantial quantities of DEF onto the ground or send DEF to wastewater
treatment facilities.


### Diesel Engine Coolant (engine with wet sleeve cylinder liners)

**IMPORTANT**: Do not use cooling system sealing additives or antifreeze
that contains sealing additives.

Do not mix ethylene glycol
and propylene glycol base coolants.

Do not use coolants
that contain nitrites.


Failure to follow applicable coolant standards and drain intervals
can result in severe engine damage that may not be covered under warranty.
Warranties, including the emissions warranty, are not conditioned
on the use of John Deere coolants, parts, or service.

#### Preferred Coolants

The following pre-mix engine coolants are preferred:

- **John Deere COOL-GARD**COOL-GARD is a trademark
of Deere & Company™**II**
- **John Deere COOL-GARD II PG**

COOL-GARD II pre-mix coolant is available in several concentrations
with different freeze protection limits as shown in the following
table.

Not all COOL-GARD II pre-mix products are available in all countries.

Use COOL-GARD II PG when a non-toxic coolant formulation is
required.

#### Additional Recommended Coolants

The following engine coolant is also recommended:

- John Deere COOL-GARD II Concentrate in a 40—60% mixture
of concentrate with quality water.

**IMPORTANT**: When mixing coolant concentrate with water, do not
use less than 40% or greater than 60% concentration of coolant. Less
than 40% gives inadequate additives for corrosion protection. Greater
than 60% can result in coolant gelation and cooling system problems.


#### Other Coolants

Other ethylene glycol or propylene glycol base coolants may
be used if they meet the following specification:

- Pre-mix coolant meeting ASTM D6210 requirements
- Is formulated with a 2-ethylhexanoic acid (2-EHA) free
additive package
- Coolant concentrate meeting ASTM D6210 requirements in
a 40—60% mixture of concentrate with quality water

If coolant meeting one of these specifications is unavailable,
use a coolant concentrate or pre-mix coolant that has a minimum of
the following chemical and physical properties:

- Provides cylinder liner cavitation protection according
to either the John Deere Cavitation Test Method or a fleet study run
at or above 60% load capacity
- Is formulated with a nitrite-free additive package
- Is formulated with a 2-ethylhexanoic acid (2-EHA) free
additive package
- Protects the cooling system metals (cast iron, aluminum
alloys, and copper alloys such as brass) from corrosion

#### Water Quality

Water quality is important to the performance of the cooling
system. Deionized or demineralized water is recommended for mixing
with ethylene glycol and propylene glycol base engine coolant concentrate.

#### Coolant Drain Intervals

Drain and flush the cooling system and refill with fresh coolant
at the indicated interval, which varies with the coolant used.

When COOL-GARD II or COOL-GARD II PG is used, the drain interval
is 6 years or 6000 hours of operation.

If a coolant other than COOL-GARD II or COOL-GARD II PG is used,
reduce the drain interval to 2 years or 2000 hours of operation.Coolant analysis may extend the service interval of other
"Coolants" to a maximum not to exceed the interval of Cool-Gard
II coolants. Coolant analysis means taking a series of coolant samples
at 1000 hour increments beyond the normal service interval until either
the data indicate the end of useful coolant life or the maximum service
interval of Cool-Gard II is reached.


### John Deere COOL-GARD™ II Coolant Extender

**IMPORTANT**: Do not use COOL-GARD II Test Strips with COOL-GARD
II PG.


**IMPORTANT**: Do not add a supplemental coolant additive when the
cooling system is drained and refilled with any of the following:

John Deere COOL-GARD II

John Deere COOL-GARD II PG


Some coolant additives gradually deplete during engine operation.
For COOL-GARDCOOL-GARD is a trademark of Deere & Company™ II pre-mix and COOL-GARD II Concentrate, replenish coolant additives
between drain intervals by adding COOL-GARD II Coolant Extender.

COOL-GARD II Coolant Extender should not be added unless indicated
by COOL-GARD II Test Strips. These test strips provide a simple, effective
method to check the freeze point, additive levels, and pH of your
engine coolant.

Test the coolant solution at intervals of 12 months and whenever
excessive coolant is lost through leaks or overheating.

COOL-GARD II Coolant Extender is a chemically matched additive
system for use with all COOL-GARD II coolants. COOL-GARD II Coolant
Extender is not intended for use with nitrite-containing coolants.

The use of non-recommended supplemental coolant additives can
result in additive drop-out, gelation of the coolant, or corrosion
of cooling system components.

Add the recommended concentration of COOL-GARD II Coolant Extender.
DO NOT add more than the recommended amount.


### Operating in Warm Temperature Climates

**IMPORTANT**: Water may be used as coolant in emergency situations only.

Foaming, hot surface
aluminum and iron corrosion, scaling, and cavitation occur when water
is used as the coolant, even when coolant conditioners are added.

Drain cooling system and refill with recommended engine coolant
as soon as possible.


John Deere engines are designed to operate using recommended
engine coolants.

Always use a recommended engine coolant, even when operating
in geographical areas where freeze protection is not required.


### Water Quality for Mixing with Coolant Concentrate

**IMPORTANT**: Do not use bottled drinking water because it often
contains higher concentrations of total dissolved solids.


Engine coolants are a combination of three chemical components:
ethylene glycol (EG) or propylene glycol (PG) antifreeze, inhibiting
coolant additives, and quality water.

Water quality is important to the performance of the cooling
system. Deionized or demineralized water is recommended for mixing
with ethylene glycol and propylene glycol base engine coolant concentrate.

All water used in the cooling system should meet the following
minimum specifications for quality:

*Water Quality*

|  Chlorides  |  <40 mg/L   |
|------------|------------|
|  Sulfates  |  <100 mg/L  |
|  Total solids  |  <340 mg/L  |
|  Total dissolved I hardness  |  <170 mg/L  |
|   pH  |  5.5—9.0  |

#### Freeze Protection

The relative concentrations of glycol and water in the engine
coolant determine its freeze protection limit.

DO NOT use a coolant-water mixture greater than 60% ethylene
glycol or 60% propylene glycol.


### Testing Coolant Freeze Point

![Image]
![Image]

The use of a handheld coolant refractometer is the quickest,
easiest, and most accurate method to determine coolant freeze point.
This method is more accurate than a test strip or a float-type hydrometer
which can produce poor results.

A coolant refractometer is available through your John Deere
dealer under the SERVICEGARDSERVICEGARD is a trademark of Deere & Company™ tool program. Part number 75240 provides an economical
solution to accurate freeze point determination in the field.

### Oil Filters

Filtration of oils is critically important for proper operation
and lubrication. John Deere brand oil filters have been designed and
produced specifically for John Deere applications.

John Deere filters adhere to engineering specifications for
quality of the filter media, filter efficiency rating, strength of
the bond between the filter media and the element end cap, fatigue
life of the canister (if applicable), and pressure capability of the
filter seal. Non-John Deere branded oil filters might not meet these
key John Deere specifications.

Always change oil filters regularly as specified in this manual.


### Fuel Filters

The importance of fuel filtration cannot be overemphasized with
modern fuel systems. The combination of increasingly restrictive emission
regulations and more efficient engines requires fuel system to operate
at much higher pressures. Higher pressures can only be achieved using
fuel injection components with very close tolerances. These close
manufacturing tolerances have significantly reduced capacities for
debris and water.

John Deere brand fuel filters have been designed and produced
specifically for John Deere engines.

To protect the engine from debris and water, always change engine
fuel filters as specified in this manual.


### Alternative and Synthetic Lubricants

Conditions in certain geographical areas may require lubricant
recommendations different from those printed in this manual.

Some John Deere brand coolants and lubricants may not be available
in your location.

Consult your John Deere dealer to obtain information and recommendations.

Synthetic lubricants may be used if they meet the performance
requirements as shown in this manual.

The temperature limits and service intervals shown in this manual
apply to John Deere branded fluids or fluids that have been tested
and/or approved for use in John Deere equipment.

Re-refined base stock products may be used if the finished lubricant
meets the performance requirements.


### Lubricant Storage

Your equipment can operate at top efficiency only when clean
lubricants are used.

 Use clean containers to handle all lubricants.

Store lubricants and containers in an area protected from dust,
moisture, and other contamination. Store containers on their side
to avoid water and dirt accumulation.

Make certain that all containers are properly marked to identify
their contents.

Properly dispose of all old containers and any residual lubricant
they may contain.


### Mixing of Lubricants

In general, avoid mixing different brands or types of oil. Oil
manufacturers blend additives in their oils to meet certain specifications
and performance requirements.

Mixing different oils can interfere with the proper functioning
of these additives and degrade lubricant performance.

Consult your John Deere dealer to obtain specific information
and recommendations.


## Lubrication and Maintenance

### Service Interval—Setup or Clearing

**CAUTION**: To prevent injury, never lubricate or service machine,
header, or engine while it is running. Shut OFF engine, set park brake

further information.



### Hydraulic Hose Replacement

**CAUTION**: If incorrectly rated hose is used, machine damage,
injury or death could occur.


Hydraulic hoses should be inspected frequently for leakage,
kinking, cuts, cracks, abrasion, corrosion, exposed wire braid, or
any other signs of wear or damage. Worn or damaged hose assemblies
can fail during use and should be replaced immediately. See your John
Deere dealer for replacement hoses.

If hoses are to be fabricated, ensure that hoses are the same
rating as one being replaced. See your John Deere dealer for correct
hose rating replacements.

Incorrect hose length or routing can increase chance of hose
wear or damage. Use old hose as guide for length and hose routing.

Incorrect fittings can damage mating parts or cause leaks. Make
sure to use steel fittings approved for use with hose manufacture.
Use correct size and thread type as replaced hose.


### Hydraulic System Cleanliness

**CAUTION**: 

High-Pressure Fluids
Escaping fluid under pressure can penetrate the skin causing
serious injury. Avoid the hazard by relieving pressure before disconnecting
hydraulic or other lines. Tighten all connections before applying
pressure. Search for leaks with a piece of cardboard. Protect hands
and body from high-pressure fluids.

If an accident occurs,
see a doctor immediately. Any fluid injected into the skin must be
surgically removed within a few hours or gangrene can result. Doctors
unfamiliar with this type of injury may call the Deere & Company
Medical Department in Moline, Illinois, or other knowledgeable medical
source.


#### Cleanliness

If hydraulic system should be disconnected for service, protect
ends of hoses, tubing, and ports of components from contamination
with clean, lint-free towels or clean plastic bags.

Before installing any replacement hose, flush the inside with
unused diesel fuel or unused commercial petroleum cleaning solvent
for 10 seconds minimum. Do not use water, water soluble cleaners,
or compressed air.

**IMPORTANT**: To prevent hydraulic system contamination, clean
the hydraulic component surfaces with an electrical contact cleaner.


Open the multicoupler covers (header and combine) and clean
the multicoupler surfaces of any dirt and debris.


### Accumulator Pressure

**NOTE**: Due to temperature differences, accumulator pressures
can vary significantly and will need to be adjusted. See your John
Deere dealer for further information.



### Using High-Pressure Washers

**IMPORTANT**: 

High-Pressure Washers
High-pressure washers are an effective means of cleaning
the machine. To avoid damage to the machine, do not go closer to 1
m (39 in) and spray at an angle between 45—90 degrees when cleaning
sealing surfaces, seals, and decals. Maximum pressure must not exceed
12 000 kPa (120 bar) (1740 psi).

Do not, under any circumstances,
spray, or wash components (example; engine) with cold water when hot.
Do not use rotary nozzles or water at temperatures over 50°C (122°F),
and do not aim at seals. Always keep the water jet moving. Reduce
pressure when using high-pressure washer to clean cooling units, bearings,
and electronic/electrical equipment. Directing pressurized water at
electronic/electrical components or connectors, bearings and hydraulics
seals, fuel injection pumps or other sensitive parts and components
may cause product malfunctions. Follow the instructions in the high-pressure
washer operator’s manual and manuals of attached equipment.



### Using Pressurized Air

**IMPORTANT**: 

Compressed Air
Directing pressurized air at electronic/electrical components
or connectors, may cause buildup of static electricity and product
malfunctions.



### Lubrication Symbols

**CAUTION**: Never lubricate or service machine while the engine
is running.

 Lubricate with John Deere Multipurpose SD
Polyurea Grease High Temperature/Extreme Pressure lubricant or an
equal SAE Multipurpose High Temperature Grease with Extreme Pressure
(EP) performance at hours shown on the symbol.

 Lubricate
with John Deere SAE 30 oil or heavier oil at hourly intervals indicated
on the symbols.



### Service Your Machine at Specified Intervals

Perform lubrication, checks, and adjustments at intervals specified
in the following tables. Perform service on items at multiples of
the original requirement. For example, at 1000 operating hours also
service those items listed under every 500 operating hours, every
250 operating hours, every 100 operating hours, and every 25 operating
hours or daily.


### Important Considerations

**IMPORTANT**: Clean fittings before and after applying grease.
Replace any damaged or missing fittings immediately.


Lubrication and maintenance intervals are listed in this section.

Locations and procedures are listed in the section for that
interval.

a doctor familiar with this type injury or gangrene may result.



### Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) Tank—Filling

**CAUTION**: 

Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) Tank Cap and Breather

ACap
BDiesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) Tank Breather

Diesel exhaust fluid (DEF) contains urea. Do not get fluid
in eyes. In case of contact, immediately flush eyes with large amounts
of water for a minimum of 15 minutes. In the event DEF is ingested,
contact a physician immediately. Reference Materials Safety Data Sheet
(MSDS) for additional information. 


Cap (A) is not vented. Excess air is vented through Diesel exhaust
fluid (DEF) tank breather (B).

Visually inspect the breather. Do not allow excessive amounts
of chaff or debris to collect on the breather. If the breather is
covered with debris, it does not allow the tank to breathe. Remove
the breather from the hose and clean.

Fill tank every time the machine is refueled. If this cannot
be done, monitor the Diesel exhaust fluid (DEF) level indicator on
the corner post display and refill as necessary. To avoid drastic
changes in the machine performance, always keep the fluid level above
the topmost red mark on the level indicator. See Combine Overview
Application Help or Operator’s Station for further information.

To fill tank:

1. Wash and rinse containers with distilled water to remove
contaminants before adding the fluid.
1. Wipe area around the cap before removing to reduce the
chance of contaminating fluid.

**IMPORTANT**: Long-term storage of fluids in the vehicle (over
12 months) is not recommended. If long-term storage is necessary,
periodic testing of the fluid is recommended to ensure that the urea
concentration does not fall out of specification.

If an
unapproved fluid, such as diesel fuel or engine coolant is added,
drain the tank and rinse with distilled water, then refill the tank.
If the system does not operate correctly after cleaning and refilling,
contact your John Deere dealer to determine how to clean and purge
the system. If water has been added to the tank, drain tank, flush
with distilled water, and refill with Diesel exhaust fluid (DEF).
Check the concentration of fluid after filling the tank. See Fuels

### Cleaning Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) Tank

**CAUTION**: Avoid contact with eyes. In case of contact, immediately
flush eyes with large amounts of water for a minimum of 15 minutes.
Reference the Materials Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for additional information.


If foreign material or fluid has been added to the DEF tank,
drain the DEF tank, flush, and fill with new DEF.

If DEF quality is in question, pull a sample out of the DEF
tank and place into a clear container. DEF should be crystal clear
with a light ammonia smell. If DEF appears cloudy, has a colored tint,
or has a profound ammonia smell, it is likely not within specification.
DEF in this condition should not be used.

1. Remove drain plug (if
equipped), and drain or siphon bad DEF from DEF tank.


2. **NOTE**: Cleaning can take place with DEF tank installed or removed.


**NOTE**: Cleaning can take place with DEF tank installed or removed.

### Diesel Particulate Filter Aftertreatment Replacement (Stage
V)



Diesel Particulate Filter
The exhaust filter includes the diesel oxidation catalyst
and diesel particulate filter (DPF). The DPF is designed to retain
residual ash, which is a noncombustible result of additives used in
crankcase lubrication oils and the fuel. The DPF provides many hours
of maintenance-free operation. At some point, the DPF requires professional
service or replacement to remove the accumulated ash. The exact number
of hours of operation before service or replacement is required varies
depending upon the engine’s power category, duty cycle and operating
conditions, engine oil ash content, and fuel quality. Adhering to
John Deere’s recommended oil and fuel specifications will maximize
the hours of operation before professional DPF service or replacement
is required.

As the engine owner, you are responsible for performing the
required maintenance described in your Operator’s Manual. During normal
equipment operation, the DPF maintenance requirements will depend
on the rate at which ash accumulates in it. DPFs on engines above
175 hp/130 kW may require service or replacement at about 4500 hours.
As ash levels rise in the DPF, the capacity for soot storage is reduced
and the back pressure of the exhaust system will rise more frequently.
A diagnostic trouble code will appear, indicating when the DPF needs
servicing.

The removal of DPF ash must be done by removing the DPF from
the machine and placing it into specialized equipment. Do not remove
ash by using water or chemicals. Removing ash by these methods may
damage the material securing the DPF in its canister, resulting in
the loosening of the DPF element in the canister and subjecting it
to damage from vibration. 

Failure to follow the approved ash removal methods may violate
U.S. federal, state, and local hazardous waste laws, and may also
damage the DPF, resulting in potential denial of the diesel exhaust
filter emissions warranty. It is strongly recommended you take the
DPF to an authorized John Deere service location or other qualified
service provider for service or replacement.

When AUTO or PARKED cleaning is enabled, the exhaust temperature
may be high under no load or light load conditions at certain times
during the exhaust filter cleaning cycle.

Disable exhaust filter cleaning system in conditions where it
may be unsafe for elevated exhaust temperatures.

Disable the automatic exhaust filter cleaning system only when
necessary.


### Exhaust Filter / Diesel Particulate Filter Ash Handling and
Disposal (Stage V)

**CAUTION**: Under federal, state, and/or local laws or regulations,
diesel particulate filter (DPF) ash may be classified as a hazardous
waste. Hazardous waste must be disposed of in accordance with all
applicable federal, state, and local laws or regulations governing
hazardous waste disposal. Only a qualified service provider should
remove ash from the DPF.  Personal protective equipment and clothing,
maintained in a sanitary and reliable condition, should be used when
handling and cleaning a DPF. See your John Deere dealer or qualified
service provider for assistance.



### Exhaust Filter Disposal (Stage V)

**CAUTION**: Proper management of an exhaust filter that has reached
the end of its useful life is required, since the ash or catalyst
material in the device may be classified as hazardous waste under
federal, state, and/or local laws or regulations. Used exhaust filter,
which includes the diesel particulate filter (DPF), may be exchanged
at any John Deere dealer or qualified service provider.

### Preparing Machine for Storage

**CAUTION**: Do not use gasoline for cleaning.


**IMPORTANT**: Long-term storage in vehicle (over 12 months) is
not recommended. If long-term storage is necessary, periodic testing
of diesel exhaust fluid (DEF) is recommended to ensure that urea concentration
does not fall out of specification.


**IMPORTANT**: Final Tier 4/Stage V: Do not disconnect battery for
at least 90 seconds after machine is shut OFF. Selective catalyst
reduction (SCR) system automatically purges lines of diesel exhaust
fluid (DEF) during this time, immediately after machine is shut OFF.
If adequate time is not allowed for lines to be purged, any fluid
remaining in lines can crystallize and plug lines. Fluid freezes and
possibly burst lines in freezing weather conditions.


**IMPORTANT**: Directing pressurized water at electronic/electrical
components or connectors, bearings and hydraulic seals, fuel injection
pumps, or other sensitive parts and components may cause product malfunctions.
Reduce pressure, and spray at a 45° to 90° angle.


**NOTE**: It is not necessary to wax the machine. However, if desired,
use a good clear wax that contains no abrasives. These types of waxes
usually do not contain cleaners.


**IMPORTANT**: To stabilize the fuel and prevent water condensation,
add fuel conditioner when the following occurs:

Fuel is stored in the fuel tanks (machine or farm storage)
for extended periods of time. See your John Deere dealer for recommendations.

A slow turnover of fuel is being used. See your John Deere
dealer for recommendations.

For prolonged machine storage, the best practice is to drain

### Emissions Control System Certification Label

**CAUTION**: Statutes providing severe penalties for tampering with
emissions controls may apply to the user or dealer.


![Image]

The emissions warranty applies to those engines marketed by
John Deere that have been certified by the United States Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) and/or California Air Resources Board (CARB);
and used in the United States and Canada in Non-road equipment. The
presence of an emissions label like the one shown signifies that the
engine has been certified with the EPA and/or CARB. The EPA and CARB
warranties only apply to new engines having the certification label
affixed to the engine and sold as stated above in the geographic areas.
The presence of an EU number signifies that the engine has been certified
with the European Union countries per Regulation (EU) 2016/1628 and
supplementing legislation. The EPA and/or CARB emissions warranties
do not apply to the EU countries.

The emissions label has applicable US EPA and/or CARB regulatory
year. The regulatory year determines which warranty statement is applicable
to engine. See “EPA Non-road Emissions Control Warranty Statement—Compression
Ignition” and “CARB Non-road Emissions Control Warranty Statement—Compression
Ignition”. For additional regulatory year warranty statements, see
www.JohnDeere.com or contact the nearest John Deere service dealer
for assistance.

**Emission Control System(s) Laws**

The U.S. EPA and California ARB prohibit the removal or rendering
inoperative of any device or element of design installed on or in
engines/equipment in compliance with applicable emission regulations
prior to or after the sale and delivery of the engines/equipment to
the ultimate purchaser.


### Carbon Dioxide Emissions (CO₂)

**NOTE**: The first letter of the family number is not utilized
for family identification on the chart.


![Image]

To identify the carbon dioxide (CO₂) output, locate the engine
emissions label. Find the appropriate family on the emissions label
and reference the chart.

This CO₂ measurement results from testing over a fixed test
cycle under laboratory conditions a(n) (parent) engine representative
of the engine type (engine family) and shall not imply or express
any guarantee of the performance of a particular engine.

|  The nominal torque values listed are for general use only with the assumed wrenching accuracy of 20%, such as a manual torque wrench. DO NOT use these values if a different torque value or tightening procedure is given for a specific application. For lock nuts, for stainless steel fasteners, or for nuts on U-bolts, see the tightening instructions for the specific application.  | | | | | | | | |  Replace fasteners with the same or higher property class. If higher property class fasteners are used, tighten these to the strength of the original.  | | | | | | | |
|   Make sure that fastener threads are clean. Apply a thin coat of Hy-Gard™ or equivalent oil under the head and on the threads of the fastener, as shown in the following image. Be conservative with the amount of oil to reduce the potential for hydraulic lockup in blind holes due to excessive oil. Properly start thread engagement.  | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |

|  The nominal torque values listed are for general use only with the assumed wrenching accuracy of 20%, such as a manual torque wrench. DO NOT use these values if a different torque value or tightening procedure is given for a specific application. For lock nuts, for stainless steel fasteners, or for nuts on U-bolts, see the tightening instructions for the specific application.  | | | | | | | | |  Replace fasteners with the same or higher property class. If higher property class fasteners are used, tighten these to the strength of the original.  | | | | | | | |
|   Make sure that fastener threads are clean. Apply a thin coat of Hy-Gard™ or equivalent oil under the head and on the threads of the fastener, as shown in the following image. Be conservative with the amount of oil to reduce the potential for hydraulic lockup in blind holes due to excessive oil. Properly start thread engagement.  | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
